## How to set up the Rental Management Application

- Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed on your local machine, including PHP, Composer, and a web server like Apache or Nginx.

- Use Git to clone the Laravel app repository from Bitbucket to your local machine.

- Navigate to the root directory of the cloned project using a terminal or command prompt.

- Run the `composer install` command to install all of the required PHP packages for the project.

- Set the necessary environment variables by copying the `.env.example` file to a new file called `.env` and filling in the appropriate values for your local development environment.`cp .env.example .env`

- Generate an application key for your Laravel app by running the `php artisan key:generate` command.

- Set up your local database by creating a new database and updating the DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, and DB_PASSWORD values in your `.env` file.

- Run the `php artisan migrate` command to run any database migrations and set up the necessary tables in your database.

- Start the development server by running the `php artisan serve` command.

- Open a web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal to view your Laravel app. This will typically be something like http://127.0.0.1:8000.
