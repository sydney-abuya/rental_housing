## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## How to set up the Reantal Management Application

- Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed on your local machine, including PHP, Composer, and a web server like Apache or Nginx.

- Use Git to clone the Laravel app repository from Bitbucket to your local machine.

- Navigate to the root directory of the cloned project using a terminal or command prompt.

- Run the composer install command to install all of the required PHP packages for the project.

- Set the necessary environment variables by copying the .env.example file to a new file called .env and filling in the appropriate values for your local development environment.

- Generate an application key for your Laravel app by running the php artisan key:generate command.

- Set up your local database by creating a new database and updating the DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, and DB_PASSWORD values in your .env file.

- Run the php artisan migrate command to run any database migrations and set up the necessary tables in your database.

- Start the development server by running the php artisan serve command.

- Open a web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal to view your Laravel app. This will typically be something like http://127.0.0.1:8000.
